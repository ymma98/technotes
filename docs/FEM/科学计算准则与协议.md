## 准则


Best Practices for Scientific Computing, Greg Wilson, et al.

1.  **Write programs for people, not computers**: Emphasizes writing readable and understandable code, considering human cognitive limitations.
    
2.  **Let the computer do the work**: Advocates for automation of repetitive tasks to save time and reduce errors.
    
3.  **Make incremental changes**: Recommends frequent feedback and course corrections, and the use of version control systems to manage changes efficiently.
    
4.  **Don't repeat yourself (or others)**: Stresses the importance of avoiding duplication in code and data to ease maintenance and ensure consistency.
    
5.  **Plan for mistakes**: Highlights defensive programming, testing, and debugging as crucial for catching and fixing errors effectively.
    
6.  **Optimize software only after it works correctly**: Advises on optimizing code for performance only after ensuring it functions correctly, and encourages the use of high-level languages for productivity.
    
7.  **Document design and purpose, not mechanics**: Suggests documenting the rationale behind code and design decisions rather than the code itself to facilitate understanding and maintenance.
    
8.  **Collaborate**: Encourages code reviews, pair programming, and issue tracking to improve code quality and facilitate knowledge sharing within teams.
