# 有限元空间

# 1 Hilbert spaces

From a mathematical point of view, the "right" choice of function space is essential since this may make it easier to **prove the existence of a solution** to the continuous problem.  
A weak formulation is obtained by multiplying the original equation by test functions and then integrate it. _The advantage of the weak formulation is that it is easy to prove the existence of a solution._

### Definition 1. Linear form.
If \(V\) is a linear space, we say that \(L\) is a linear form in \(V\) if \(L: V \to \mathbb{R}\), i.e., \(L(v) \in \mathbb{R}\) for \(v \in V\), and \(L\) is linear, i.e., for all \(v, w \in V\) and \(\beta, \theta \in \mathbb{R}\), 
\[
L(\beta v + \theta w) = \beta L(v) + \theta L(w)
\]

### Definition 2. Bilinear form.
\(a(\cdot, \cdot)\) is a bilinear form on \(V \times V\) if \(a: V \times V \to \mathbb{R}\).  
i.e., \(a(v, w) \in \mathbb{R}\) for \(v, w \in V\), and \(a(\cdot, \cdot)\) is linear in each argument, i.e., for all \(u, v, w \in V\) and \(\beta, \theta \in \mathbb{R}\), we have
\[
a(u, \beta v + \theta w) = \beta a(u, v) + \theta a(u, w)
\]
\[
a(\beta u + \theta v, w) = \beta a(u, w) + \theta a(v, w)
\]
The bilinear form \(a(\cdot, \cdot)\) is symmetric on \(V \times V\) if \(a(v, w) = a(w, v)\).

### Definition 3. Scalar product.
A scalar product is a symmetric bilinear form \(a(\cdot, \cdot)\) on \(V \times V\) where \(a(\cdot, \cdot) > 0\) for all \(v \in V\), \(v \neq 0\).

### Definition 4. Norm.
The norm \(\|\cdot\|_a\) associated with a scalar product \(a(\cdot, \cdot)\) is defined by
\[
\|v\|_a = [a(v, v)]^{1/2} \quad \forall v \in V
\]

_(bilinear product → scalar product → norm)_
