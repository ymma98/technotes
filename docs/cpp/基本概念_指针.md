Data/BSS (Block Started by Symbol) segments are larger than stack memory (max ≈ 1GB in general) but slower

|  | Stack | Heap |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Memory <br> Organization | Contiguous (LIFO) | Contiguous within an allocation, <br> Fragmented between allocations <br> (relies on virtual memory) |
| Max size | Small (8MB on Linux, 1MB on <br> Windows) | Whole system memory |
| If exceed | Program crash at function <br> entry (hard to debug) | Exception or nullptr |
| Allocation | Compile-time | Run-time |
| Locality | High | Low |
| Thread View | Each thread has its own stack | Shared among threads |
